# hello-world

This is my first repository on GitHub.

I currently work with ColdFusion, JavaScript, and SQL Server.

I have additional interests in PHP and .NET and would love to experiment with Machine Learning.

I would like to find some open source projects to join, preferably with a "Social Good" slant.
